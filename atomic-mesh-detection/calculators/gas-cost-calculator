gas-cost-calculator: Calculates detailed gas costs

Calculates gas costs across all chains involved in an arbitrage,
including L2 calldata costs and priority fees.

Features:
- Per-operation gas estimation
- L2 calldata cost calculation
- Priority fee optimization
- Batch transaction savings
- Gas token considerations
- Historical gas analysis

Input: Execution path
Output: Detailed gas breakdown
