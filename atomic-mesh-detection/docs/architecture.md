# Atomic Mesh Detection Architecture

## Overview

The detection system uses a unified node architecture across 5 chains with direct mempool access for sub-millisecond arbitrage detection.

## Components

### Node Infrastructure
- Unified Reth implementation
- Direct IPC connections
- Custom mempool processing
- State tracking

### Detection Pipeline
- Extractors: Pull data from nodes
- Analyzers: Process opportunities
- Validators: Ensure executability
- Formatters: Prepare for execution

### Integration
- Direct socket connection to execution
- Real-time feedback loop
- Capability synchronization

## Performance Targets
- Detection latency: < 5ms
- Node sync time: < 10 minutes
- Opportunity validation: < 1ms
