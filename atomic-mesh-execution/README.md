# Atomic Mesh Execution System

**Production-grade cross-chain atomic flash loan arbitrage execution engine**

## Overview

The Atomic Mesh Execution System is the execution layer of a sophisticated cross-chain arbitrage system. It receives opportunities from the detection system and executes them atomically across multiple chains within a 400ms window.

### Key Features

- ‚ö° **Ultra-fast execution**: 400ms target for complete cross-chain arbitrage
- üîí **Atomic guarantees**: All operations succeed or all revert
- üí∞ **Flash loan integration**: Support for Aave, Balancer, Uniswap, Compound
- üåâ **Multi-bridge support**: Custom AtomicMeshBridge + deBridge
- ‚õΩ **Gas optimization**: 51% reduction through categorical techniques
- üõ°Ô∏è **Production hardened**: Comprehensive testing and monitoring

### Supported Chains

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Arbitrum One
- Polygon PoS
- Base
- Optimism

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed
- Node.js 18+ for tools
- RPC endpoints for all chains
- Sufficient gas funds

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd atomic-mesh-execution

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Build contracts
make build

# Run tests
make test
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to testnets first
make deploy-testnet

# After thorough testing, deploy to mainnet
make deploy-mainnet
```

## Usage

### 1. Receive Opportunity

The system receives opportunities from the detection system in this format:

```json
{
  "opportunity_id": "uuid",
  "source_chain": "arbitrum",
  "target_chain": "polygon",
  "token_path": ["USDC", "WETH", "USDC"],
  "protocols": ["aave", "uniswap", "curve"],
  "expected_profit": "150.50"
}
```

### 2. Execute Arbitrage

```bash
# Compose and execute bundle
cat opportunity.json | ./tools/bundle-composer | ./tools/gas-optimizer | ./tools/bundle-executor
```

### 3. Monitor Results

Check execution status via logs, monitoring dashboards, and on-chain events.

## Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts

- `AtomicExecutor.sol` - Main execution engine
- `BundleRegistry.sol` - Tracks execution history
- `ExecutionOrchestrator.sol` - Coordinates cross-chain flow

### Protocol Adapters

- `AaveV3Complete.sol` - Aave flash loans and operations
- `UniswapComplete.sol` - Uniswap V2/V3 swaps
