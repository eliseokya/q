# Validator Design Documentation

This directory contains the detailed design documentation for the Atomic Mesh Validator system and its four sub-modules.

## Structure

- `compiler-design/` - Design documents for the JSON â†’ DSL compiler module
- `analyzer-design/` - Design documents for the pattern matching analyzer module (to be created)
- `proof-verifier-design/` - Design documents for the proof verification module (to be created)
- `bundle-generator-design/` - Design documents for the bundle generation module (to be created)

## Purpose

The Validator is the mathematical validation layer that ensures only provably correct atomic operations proceed to execution. It achieves this through pattern matching against pre-proven mathematical theorems rather than runtime theorem proving.

## Module Overview

1. **Compiler**: Transforms opportunity JSON into mathematical DSL
2. **Analyzer**: Matches DSL expressions against proven patterns
3. **Proof Verifier**: Validates constraints and feasibility
4. **Bundle Generator**: Creates executable bundles from verified patterns

Each module's design folder contains detailed specifications, data flow diagrams, and implementation guidelines.
