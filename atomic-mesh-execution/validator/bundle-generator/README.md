# Bundle Generator Module

## Purpose
The Bundle Generator module is the final stage in the validator pipeline, responsible for transforming verified patterns into executable bundles with all concrete implementation details needed for on-chain execution.

## Functionality
- Takes Analysis Results from the Analyzer containing validated patterns with their parameters
- Resolves abstract operations to concrete contract addresses
- Encodes function parameters for smart contract calls
- Calculates dynamic values and dependencies between operations
- Optimizes execution ordering for gas efficiency
- Adds gas configurations with safety buffers
- Calculates deadlines based on current block
- Generates fallback options for increased reliability

## Input/Output
- **Input**: Analysis Result from Analyzer (FullMatch with pattern parameters)
- **Output**: Execution Bundle JSON ready for on-chain execution

## Performance Target
- < 3ms bundle generation time

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Bundle generation logic
- `test/`: Unit tests
- `bin/`: Compiled executable

## Key Responsibilities
1. Contract address resolution for each chain
2. ABI encoding of function calls
3. Gas limit calculation
4. Deadline computation
5. Fallback strategy generation
6. Bundle metadata creation
