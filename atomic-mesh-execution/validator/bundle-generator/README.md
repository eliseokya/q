# Bundle Generator Module

## Purpose
The Bundle Generator module creates executable bundles from verified patterns, translating abstract mathematical operations into concrete smart contract calls.

## Functionality
- Resolves abstract operations to concrete contract addresses
- Encodes function parameters for smart contract calls
- Calculates dynamic values and dependencies
- Optimizes execution ordering
- Adds gas configurations and deadlines
- Generates fallback options

## Input/Output
- **Input**: Verified Pattern from Proof Verifier
- **Output**: Execution Bundle JSON ready for execution tools

## Performance Target
- < 3ms bundle generation time

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Bundle generation logic
- `test/`: Unit tests
- `bin/`: Compiled executable

## Key Responsibilities
1. Contract address resolution for each chain
2. ABI encoding of function calls
3. Gas limit calculation
4. Deadline computation
5. Fallback strategy generation
6. Bundle metadata creation
