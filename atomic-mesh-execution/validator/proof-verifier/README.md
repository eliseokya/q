# Proof Verifier Module

## Purpose
The Proof Verifier module validates mathematical constraints and performs real-time feasibility checks for matched patterns.

## Functionality
- Validates that the Lean proof certificate is valid
- Checks pattern instantiation satisfies theorem preconditions
- Verifies mathematical properties (atomicity, value preservation)
- Performs real-time feasibility checks:
  - Gas cost estimation
  - Timing constraints
  - Bridge availability
  - Liquidity sufficiency
- Provides detailed failure reasons

## Input/Output
- **Input**: Matched Pattern from Analyzer
- **Output**: Verified Pattern with all constraint checks

## Performance Target
- < 10ms verification time

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Verification logic
- `test/`: Unit tests
- `bin/`: Compiled executable

## Key Verifications
1. Mathematical constraints from the pattern theorem
2. Real-world feasibility (gas, liquidity, timing)
3. Bridge and protocol availability
4. Economic viability
