 * @title BridgeRouter
 * @notice Selects optimal bridge based on speed/cost
 * @dev Intelligent routing between bridge options:
 *      - Compares bridge fees and execution times
 *      - Checks bridge liquidity and availability
 *      - Routes to optimal bridge for the use case
 *      - Handles fallback to alternative bridges
 *      - Tracks bridge performance metrics
 * 
 * Routing factors:
 * - Execution speed (critical for arbitrage)
 * - Bridge fees and gas costs
 * - Available liquidity
 * - Historical reliability
 * - Security model preferences
 * 
 * Supported bridges:
 * - AtomicMeshBridge (fastest, custom)
 * - deBridge (reliable, good liquidity)
 * - Other bridges as fallback
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Dynamic routing algorithms
 * - Performance tracking
 * - Automatic failover
 * - Fee optimization
 * - Route caching
