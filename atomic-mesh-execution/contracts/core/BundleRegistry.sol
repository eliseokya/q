 * @title BundleRegistry
 * @notice Tracks bundle execution status and results
 * @dev This contract maintains a record of all executed bundles for:
 *      - Tracking execution status (pending, success, failed)
 *      - Recording gas used across all chains
 *      - Storing profit/loss for each bundle
 *      - Providing execution history for analysis
 *      - Enabling retry mechanisms for failed bundles
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Assigns unique IDs to each bundle
 * - Tracks which chains were involved in execution
 * - Records timestamps for execution timing analysis
 * - Stores revert reasons for failed executions
 * - Provides query functions for historical data
