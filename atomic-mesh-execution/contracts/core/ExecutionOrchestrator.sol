 * @title ExecutionOrchestrator
 * @notice Coordinates multi-chain execution flow
 * @dev This contract manages the complex orchestration of cross-chain operations:
 *      - Validates bundle parameters before execution
 *      - Coordinates timing between chains based on block times
 *      - Manages execution order for optimal gas usage
 *      - Handles partial execution recovery
 *      - Interfaces with chain-specific executors
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Implements circuit breakers for risk management
 * - Validates sufficient liquidity before execution
 * - Manages nonce coordination across chains
 * - Handles bridge timeout scenarios
 * - Provides hooks for monitoring tools
