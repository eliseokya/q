/**
 * @title AtomicExecutor
 * @notice Main execution engine for atomic cross-chain bundles
 * @dev This contract is the heart of the execution system. It:
 *      - Receives bundled operations from the bundle-composer tool
 *      - Initiates flash loans on the source chain
 *      - Coordinates cross-chain execution through bridges
 *      - Ensures atomicity: all operations succeed or all revert
 *      - Handles the flash loan callback where arbitrage happens
 *      - Validates profitability after all gas costs
 *      - Returns profits to the designated receiver
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Implements callbacks for all supported flash loan protocols
 * - Uses try/catch for safe external calls with revert on failure
 * - Integrates with BridgeRouter for optimal bridge selection
 * - Tracks execution state across multiple chains
 * - Ensures no funds are left in contract after execution
