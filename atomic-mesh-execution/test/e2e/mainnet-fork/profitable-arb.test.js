/**
 * profitable-arb.test.js: Tests real profitable opportunities
 * 
 * End-to-end tests using mainnet forks to validate the system
 * can execute real profitable arbitrage opportunities.
 * 
 * Test setup:
 * - Fork mainnet state at specific blocks
 * - Inject known price discrepancies
 * - Execute full arbitrage flow
 * - Verify actual profit
 * 
 * Scenarios tested:
 * 1. Historical opportunities
 *    - Replay past profitable trades
 *    - Verify we would have captured them
 *    - Calculate actual vs theoretical profit
 * 
 * 2. Synthetic opportunities
 *    - Create price discrepancies
 *    - Test various sizes
 *    - Multiple token pairs
 * 
 * 3. Competition simulation
 *    - Multiple bots competing
 *    - Gas price wars
 *    - MEV scenarios
 * 
 * 4. Real-time simulation
 *    - Connect to live price feeds
 *    - Execute on fork when opportunity found
 *    - Measure execution speed
 * 
 * Success criteria:
 * - Profit > gas costs + fees
 * - Execution < 400ms
 * - No reverts
