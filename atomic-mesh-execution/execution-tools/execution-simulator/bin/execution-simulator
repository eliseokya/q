/**
 * execution-simulator: Simulates bundle before execution
 * 
 * Runs the complete execution path in a simulated environment
 * to verify success before committing real funds.
 * 
 * Simulation steps:
 * 1. Fork current chain states
 * 2. Execute flash loan
 * 3. Simulate swaps with actual liquidity
 * 4. Calculate exact outputs
 * 5. Simulate bridge transfer
 * 6. Execute destination swaps
 * 7. Verify profitable outcome
 * 
 * Checks performed:
 * - Sufficient liquidity at each step
 * - No reverts in any operation
 * - Actual vs expected outputs
 * - Gas consumption accuracy
 * - Timing feasibility
 * - Slippage within bounds
 * 
 * Simulation methods:
 * - Tenderly API for mainnet forks
 * - Local Anvil/Hardhat forks
 * - State override simulations
 * - Historical data replay
 * 
 * Outputs simulation report with:
 * - Success probability
 * - Actual profit calculation
 * - Gas usage breakdown
 * - Potential failure points
 * - Optimization suggestions
