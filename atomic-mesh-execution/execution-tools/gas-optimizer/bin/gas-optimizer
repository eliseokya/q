/**
 * gas-optimizer: Optimizes bundle for minimal gas usage
 * 
 * Applies categorical optimization techniques from the mathematical model
 * to minimize gas consumption across all chains involved in execution.
 * 
 * Optimization strategies:
 * 1. Operation batching - Combine multiple ops into single transaction
 * 2. Path optimization - Find most gas-efficient route
 * 3. Data packing - Minimize calldata for L2 costs
 * 4. Protocol selection - Choose gas-optimal protocols
 * 5. Timing optimization - Execute when gas is lowest
 * 
 * Input: Bundle from bundle-composer
 * Output: Optimized bundle with gas estimates
 * 
 * Gas considerations:
 * - L1 data posting costs on L2s
 * - Different gas models per chain
 * - Protocol-specific gas consumption
 * - Bridge gas overhead
 * - Flash loan gas costs
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Real-time gas price monitoring
 * - Historical gas usage analysis
 * - Simulation-based optimization
 * - Multi-chain gas aggregation
 * - Safety margin calculations
