 * state-monitor: Monitors chain states and syncs
 * 
 * Continuously monitors blockchain states across all chains
 * to ensure execution conditions remain valid.
 * 
 * Monitoring targets:
 * - Block production rates
 * - Gas price fluctuations
 * - Liquidity changes
 * - Protocol status (paused/active)
 * - Bridge queue depths
 * - Nonce gaps
 * 
 * State tracking:
 * - Current block numbers
 * - Mempool conditions
 * - Pending transactions
 * - Contract states
 * - Token balances
 * - Price deviations
 * 
 * Alerting conditions:
 * - Chain reorganization
 * - Extreme gas spikes
 * - Protocol exploits
 * - Bridge failures
 * - Liquidity drainage
 * - Abnormal patterns
 * 
 * Integration:
 * - WebSocket connections for real-time updates
 * - RPC fallbacks for reliability
 * - State database for historical tracking
 * - Event emission for other tools
 * - Prometheus metrics export
