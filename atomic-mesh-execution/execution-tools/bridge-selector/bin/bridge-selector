/**
 * bridge-selector: Selects fastest/cheapest bridge
 * 
 * Intelligently routes cross-chain transfers through optimal bridges
 * based on current conditions and requirements.
 * 
 * Selection criteria:
 * 1. Speed (critical for 0.4s execution window)
 * 2. Cost (bridge fees + gas)
 * 3. Liquidity availability
 * 4. Reliability score
 * 5. Current congestion
 * 
 * Bridge options:
 * - AtomicMeshBridge: Fastest (~200ms), custom implementation
 * - deBridge: Good liquidity, ~1-2s, reliable
 * - LayerZero: Wide support, ~2-3s
 * - Hyperlane: Fast, good for specific routes
 * 
 * Real-time factors:
 * - Bridge queue depth
 * - Available liquidity
 * - Recent success rates
 * - Gas prices on both chains
 * - Time since last failure
 * 
 * Output includes:
 * - Selected bridge
 * - Expected time
 * - Total cost
 * - Fallback options
 * - Risk assessment
