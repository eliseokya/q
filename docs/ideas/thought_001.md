# A Categorical Model of Ethereum and Ethereum-Based Blockchains

---

## 1. Core Ethereum Category 𝓔

Objects — Accounts  
- EOAs: implicit private-key attribute  
- CAs: deployed-code attribute  

Morphisms — Transactions  
- Ordinary txs (EOA→CA, EOA→EOA) treated as simple morphisms  
- Internal calls (CA→CA) mean morphisms can factor through dynamically created objects  
- Enrich 𝓔 over a monoidal category of gas-metered effects  

Composition  
- Sequential execution is strict within a block; across blocks you may choose provenance-preserving vs state-quotiented composition  

Identity  
- `id_A` can be viewed as a no-op tx that still burns gas (unit of a costed monoid)  

---

## 2. Contracts as Diagrams

- A contract’s ABI gives a family of morphisms `{fᵢ : A → A}`  
- Contract code imposes relations among those morphisms, giving a presentation ⟨gen | rel⟩  
- Safety properties such as “total balance conserved” become diagram commutativity

## 3. DeFi Protocols as Functors 𝓕 : 𝓔 → 𝓢

Let 𝓢 be a semantic category (e.g., **State**, **Ledger**).  
A protocol functor maps raw txs to their economic meaning.

Applications:  
1. **Verification** — commutative diagrams in 𝓔 map to equal morphisms in 𝓢.  
2. **Optimisation** — aggregation enables path-independent objective functions for arbitrage search.

## 4. 2-Categories & Flash Loans

- 2-morphisms re-wire two tx sequences that share the same endpoints.  
- Flash-loan bundles are represented by invertible 2-cells equating sequences that repay before termination.  
- **Atomicity ⇔ invertibility of the 2-cell.**  

---

## 5. Cross-Chain Bicategory 𝓑

Objects: ledgers (Ethereum, Solana, L2s, …)  
1-Morphisms: bridge operations / locking schemes  
2-Morphisms: coherence proofs (light-client verification)  

An inter-chain flash loan is a 2-cell traversing composite bridge morphisms while maintaining invertibility.  

---

## 6. Why This Helps in Practice

- **Compositional reasoning**  
- **Search-space reduction** via limits/colimits  
- **Formal optimisation** through representable functors  
- **Implementation path** via typed functional languages compiling to EVM

## 7. Immediate Research / Build Steps

1. Prototype 𝓔 in a proof assistant with gas-cost enrichment.  
2. Formalise Uniswap V2 as a functor and prove \(x·y = k\).  
3. Encode a flash-loan arbitrage (Aave → Uni → Sushi → Aave) as a 2-cell; machine-check invertibility.  
4. Extend to a bicategory with Ethereum + Arbitrum and canonical bridges.  
5. Generate executable bundler code gated by proofs.  

---

## 8. Potential Pitfalls

- **State explosion** → quotienting / indexed categories  
- **Adversarial re-entrancy**  
- **Bridge latency** (temporal-logic enrichment)  
- **Economic externalities** (cost functor ℂ : 𝓔 → MonoidalPoset)  

---

## 9. Reading & Tooling

- *Categories for the Working Mathematician* — S. Mac Lane  
- *Category Theory for Programmers* — B. Milewski  
- Research on **string diagrams for open games** (Ghica et al.)  
- `act4-contracts` — categorical semantics for ACT verifier  
- Linear-logic smart-contract languages: `Nomos`, `foxx-bridge`, etc.

## 10. Closing Thought

Embedding **atomicity** and **economic soundness** as categorical commutativity/invertibility yields *correct-by-construction arbitrage engines* that remain safe even as strategies become increasingly complex and cross-chain in nature.
