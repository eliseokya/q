# DSL + Compiler for Cross-Chain Atomic Bundles

A developer-friendly surface language that hides categorical complexity while leveraging it under the hood to guarantee atomic, safe execution across multiple blockchains.

---

## 1. Goals

1. Provide a **simple, declarative syntax** for expressing cross-chain sequences like flash-loan arbitrage.  
2. Compile programs into execution bundles that are **formally verified** against the categorical spec (thought_004.md).  
3. Optimise gas, bridge selection, and liquidity while ensuring atomicity.

## 2. DSL Design Sketch

```dsl
borrow 200 WETH on polygon.aave
→ bridge arbitrum
→ swap WETH→USDC on arbitrum.uniswap minOut 298000 USDC
→ bridge polygon
→ repay polygon.aave by 200 WETH
```

Features:

* **Primitives**: `borrow`, `repay`, `swap`, `bridge`, `assert`, `parallel`, `sequence`, `retry`.
* **Typed assets & addresses**: `Asset<WETH, polygon>`, `Address<arbitrum>`.
* **Constraints**: `minOut`, `maxGas`, `deadline` embedded as assertions.
* **Combinators**: higher-order ops for loops/parallelism.

## 3. Compiler Pipeline

1. **Parsing & Type-Checking**  
   *Ensure domains/codomains align; loan balances net to zero; bridges supported.*
2. **Categorical Verification**  
   *Translate DSL into a diagram; prove it forms an invertible 2-cell.*
3. **Optimisation Passes**  
   *Path search for best liquidity, bridge delay, gas cost.*
4. **Target Code Generation**  
   *Split into per-chain call batches; attach cryptographic guards (HTLB, zk-proof, sig).* 
   Output: Relay-ready JSON/byte-code bundle + formal proof artefact.
5. **Artifact Emission**  
   *Lean/Agda proof term, gas/fee estimates, risk metrics.*

---

## 4. Runtime Architecture

* **Relay / Sequencer Network**  
  Queues sub-transactions, monitors confirmations, relays proofs, aggregates signatures.
* **On-Chain Router + Verifier Contracts**  
  Lock/borrow assets, verify proofs, enforce timeouts & refunds.
* **Failure Handling**  
  Compiler-embedded refund paths trigger automatically on any leg failure.

---

## 5. Developer Experience

* **Write** 10–20 lines of DSL instead of multiple Solidity scripts.  
* **Compile-time errors** for impossible or unsafe sequences.  
* **Optimisation report**: best route, expected gas, probability of success.  
* **Deploy** with a single command: `mesh-vm run bundle.dsl`.

---

## 6. Roadmap

1. Minimal grammar + interpreter for local simulations.  
2. Full type system mirroring categorical objects/morphisms.  
3. Back-end for two EVM chains via threshold-sig bridge.  
4. Optimisation engine (liquidity, slippage, gas).  
5. Upgrade to zk-header bridges & add non-EVM adapters.  
6. VS Code plugin (syntax, lint, static proofs).

---

## 7. Benefits

* **Simplicity** for developers, rigour under the hood.  
* **Automated safety** through categorical proofs.  
* **Composable**: any DeFi-lego pattern expressible as a program.  
* **Scalable**: new chains/bridges added by extending type universe and proof libraries.
