# Cross-Chain Atomic Execution Layer (Atomic Mesh VM)

A concrete architecture that realises the categorical model: a VM-like layer executing atomically-secured bundles (e.g., cross-chain flash-loan arbitrage) across multiple L1/L2 blockchains.

---

## 1. Overview

The VM sits **above** existing chains. A user submits a *bundle diagram*; the system verifies composability and then orchestrates chain-local calls + bridge proofs such that either *all* legs succeed or every asset is safely refunded.

---

## 2. Programming / Bundle-Description Layer

* Domain-specific language (DSL) or byte-code expresses a **diagram**:
  * **Nodes** = target chains & on-chain contracts.
  * **Arrows** = function calls (calldata, value, gas limits).
  * **Constraints** = repayment, balance invariants, timing windows.
* Compiles to an in-memory object ≅ an invertible **2-cell** in the bicategory from *thought_004.md*.
* Example bundle: `borrow(Aave-Polygon,200 WETH) → bridge → swap(Uni-Arbitrum) → bridge → repay`.

---

## 3. Execution-Planning Engine

1. Validates that morphisms compose and final state satisfies invariants.
2. Fibre-wise optimisation (slippage, gas) inside each \(\mathcal E_L(t)\).
3. Stitches fibres using bridge delay δ constraints.
4. Emits an *execution trace* with scheduled blocks + required confirmations.

## 4. Cryptographic Atomicity Primitives

| Primitive | Summary | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|---------|------|------|
| **HTLB** | Same hash + timeouts on all legs | Works today | Latency; refund races |
| **Light-Client Proof** | zk-SNARK/fraud-proof of other chain header | Single-tx atomic mint | Proving cost |
| **Threshold-Sig Notary** | Off-chain sign “bundle commit”; on-chain verify | Fast, simple | Trust ≥ t honest |
| **Optimistic Roll-Up** | Aggregate bundle to settlement chain, fraud window | Low zk cost | Delay Δ blocks |

Each maps to a **natural transformation** \(\operatorname{Br}_{L→L'}\) plus proof data that makes the 2-cell invertible.

---

## 5. Relay / Sequencer Network

* Connected to RPC of every supported chain.
* Tasks: queue & push sub-txs, watch confirmations, relay proofs, gather notary signatures.
* Economic stake → slashable for liveness/fraud.

---

## 6. Per-Chain On-Chain Contracts

* **Router** — receives bundle segment, locks or borrows assets, emits event with proof blob.
* **Verifier** — checks incoming bridge proof/signature.
* Timeout refund path for failed proofs.
* Optionally include pre-compiled zk-verifier for header proofs.

---

## 7. Global Settlement / Arbitration Layer (Optional)

* High-throughput L2 or Cosmos-style hub records canonical log of cross-chain bundles.
* Hosts dispute/fraud proofs; simplifies upgrade governance.

---

## 8. Categorical Mapping

| Categorical Concept | Engineered Check |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Invertible 2-cell | All legs succeed or bundle refunds |
| Commutative square | "Lock then mint" == "Mint equals locked" |
| Sheaf descent | Relay monitors forks/re-org depth |
| Natural-transf coherence | Bridge contract upgrades post new verifying key + transition proof |

---

## 9. Benefits

* **True atomicity** for cross-chain flash loans & DeFi legos.
* **Fee/Gas efficiency** – search only viable paths; roll up proofs.
* **Formal verification** – categorical model serves as spec; implementation can be mechanically proven.
* **Composable extension** – same VM executes any diagram (lending, LP migration, DAO treasury moves…).

## 10. Engineering Roadmap Snapshot

1. MVP on two EVM chains using threshold-sig bridge.
2. Embed diagram DSL in TypeScript/Rust; compile to JSON bundle.
3. Deploy Router + Bridge contracts; audit.
4. Launch relay network with staking & slashing.
5. Upgrade to zk-SNARK light-client proofs.
6. Add adapters for non-EVM chains (WASM, Substrate, Cosmos SDK).
