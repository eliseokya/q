# Ledger History as a Presheaf (Stack) of Categories over Time

A step-by-step construction of how evolving blockchains can be captured categorically as a **Cat-valued presheaf** (indeed, a stack) indexed by block height.

## 0. Notation & Conventions

* **Cat** – category of small categories and functors.
* **Time** – poset \((\mathbb N, \le)\) of block numbers, viewed as a category.
* **Timeᵒᵖ** – opposite category (needed for contravariance).
* Fix a finite set of blockchains \(\mathbf L = \{L_1,\dots,L_m\}.\)

---

## 1. Fibre Categories \(\mathcal E_{L}(t)\)

For each chain \(L \in \mathbf L\) and height \(t \in \mathbb N\):

* **Objects** – on-chain addresses extant by block *t*.
* **Morphisms** – all transactions included in or before block *t* (not reverted).
* **Composition** – concatenation of transaction receipts.
* **Identities** – no-op (empty) txs.

Optional enrichments: storage slots, contract internals, etc.

---

## 2. Block-to-Block Transition Functors \(\Delta_L(t \le s)\)

For \(t \le s\) define a *restriction* functor

\[ \Delta_L(t \le s) : \mathcal E_{L}(s) \to \mathcal E_{L}(t) \]

that drops everything beyond block *t*.

Functor laws hold: identities on diagonals, composition on chains of heights.

---

## 3. Chain-Level Presheaf \(F_L : \text{Time}^\text{op} \to \text{Cat}\)

* **On objects** — \(F_L(t)=\mathcal E_{L}(t)\).
* **On morphisms** — arrow \((t \le s)^\text{op}\) maps to \(\Delta_L(t \le s)\).

Thus each chain is a Cat-valued **presheaf** encoding its entire ledger history.

---

## 4. World-State Presheaf \(F = \prod_L F_L\)

Define

\[ F(t) := \prod_{L\in\mathbf L} \mathcal E_{L}(t) \]

and on morphisms take the product of the respective \(\Delta\) functors.  This single presheaf represents the *mesh* of all chains.

---

## 5. Sheaf / Stack Condition = Consensus Gluing

Given a finite cover of heights \(\{t_i\}\) and compatible sections \(\sigma_i \in F(t_i)\) that agree on overlaps, there exists a **unique** \(\sigma \in F(\max t_i)\) restricting to every \(\sigma_i\).

Because each chain’s consensus already satisfies such restriction/paste properties, \(F\) is not merely a presheaf but a **stack in Cat** (sheaf with 2-categorical data).

---

## 6. Cross-Chain Bridges as Natural Transformations

For chains \(L, L'\) with bridge delay \(\delta\) blocks, define a natural transformation

\[ \operatorname{Br}_{L\to L'} : F_L \Longrightarrow (\;t \mapsto F_{L'}(t+\delta)\;) \]

Each component functor maps a deposit on *L* at height *t* to a mint on *L'* at *t+\delta*.  Commutative squares express bridge correctness.

---

## 7. Forks & Reorgs  →  Bicategorical Upgrade

Replace **Cat** with **Bicat** and functors with pseudofunctors.  Parallel functors model competing forks; coherence 2-cells handle reorg resolution.  The presheaf becomes a **2-stack**.

---

## 8. Temporal & Probabilistic Enrichment

* Finality probabilities – enrich hom-sets with \([0,1]\) under multiplication.
* Latency costs   – enrich with \((\mathbb R_{\ge 0}, +)\).

Leads to Cat-valued presheaves enriched over a monoidal poset.

---

## 9. Grothendieck Construction ⇒ Total Bicategory \(\bar{\mathcal E}\)

Take

\[ \int_{t} F(t) \]

Objects = pairs \((t,x)\) with \(x\in\mathcal E_{L}(t)\).  Morphisms pair block advances with ledger txs; 2-cells witness commutation.  Atomic cross-chain bundles manifest as invertible 2-cells.

---

## 10. Why This Matters

* **Liveness / finality** – descent condition.
* **Bridge safety** – existence + coherence of \(\operatorname{Br}\).
* **Optimisation** – fibrewise algorithms glued by functorial structure.
* **Upgrades / forks** – pseudonatural equivalences of presheaves.

## 11. Implementation Sketch

1. **Data layer** – store each \(\mathcal E_L(t)\) as a versioned graph.
2. **Indexer** – update \(\Delta_L\) on every block arrival.
3. **Bridge module** – maintain and test \(\operatorname{Br}\) squares.
4. **Query planner** – search per-fibre, lift via bridges, validate global 2-cell.
5. **Proof engine** – Lean4/Agda libraries already support these categorical pieces.

---

## 12. Further Directions

1. Replace **Time** with the pro-category of finite intervals for variable finality windows.
2. Move to (∞,1)-categories for proof-relevant forks.
3. Model consensus as a coalgebra to prove liveness via bisimulation.
4. Build a topos of **measurable events** for categorical MEV auctions.
