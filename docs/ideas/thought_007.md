# Toward a Comprehensive Categorical Model of Ethereum & EVM-Compatible Blockchains

This blueprint refines all prior notes (`thought_001` → `thought_006`) into a single layered model covering execution semantics, contracts, tokens, protocols, and cross-chain composition.

---

## I. Modelling Goals & Scope

1. Express **all on-chain entities and actions** as categorical objects/morphisms.  
2. Capture **state, cost, and revert semantics** (gas / refunds).  
3. Model **smart-contract internal logic** and **token standards** (ERC-20, ERC-721).  
4. Enable **cross-contract, cross-protocol, cross-chain** reasoning and proofs.  
5. Keep each layer small enough to verify mechanically (Lean/Agda/Coq).

## II. Base Execution Category \(\mathcal{E}_{\text{EVM}}\)

* **Objects** — account addresses (EOA or CA).
* **Morphisms** — *traces* of EVM op-codes executed during a transaction **that terminates in `SUCCESS` or `REVERT`**.
* **Enrichment** — hom-sets carry:
  * gas-cost monoid \((\mathbb N, +, 0)\),
  * side-effect label (state-diff map),
  * refund flag (boolean).

Composition = concatenation of traces provided both end in `SUCCESS`.  If trace 1 ends in `REVERT`, composition is undefined ⇒ \(\mathcal{E}_{\text{EVM}}\) is a **partial monoidal category**; we close it under successful paths.

---

## III. Internal Categories for Smart Contracts

For a contract address C:

* Build an **internal category** \(\mathcal{C}_C\):
  * Objects = abstract storage configurations (\(\sigma_0, \sigma_1, …\)).
  * Morphisms = callable public functions \(f_i : \sigma_j → \sigma_k\) *plus* any internal calls emitted.
* A **forgetful functor** \(U_C : \mathcal{C}_C → \mathcal{E}_{\text{EVM}}\) collapses all objects to C and maps internal morphisms to their concrete EVM trace.
* Safety properties (re-entrancy guards, balance conservation) become **commuting diagrams** inside \(\mathcal{C}_C\) whose image under \(U_C\) is a single arrow.

---

## IV. Token Standards as Monoidal Functors

### 1. ERC-20 Category \(\mathcal{T}_{20}\)

* Objects = holder addresses.
* Morphisms = transfers labelled by amount; compose by adding amounts.
* A deployed ERC-20 contract gives a **strong monoidal functor**
  \[ F_{token} : \mathcal{T}_{20} \to \mathcal{E}_{\text{EVM}} \]
  preserving tensor product (parallel transfers) and unit (zero transfer).

### 2. ERC-721 Category \(\mathcal{T}_{721}\)

* Objects = token ids.
* Morphisms = ownership arrows (unique).
* Functorial image → concrete `transferFrom` calls.

---

## V. Protocols as Indexed Functors

Let **Ledger** be the category whose objects are vectors of balances + positions per account; morphisms are pure state transformers obeying protocol rules.

A DeFi protocol instance induces a **state semantics functor**
\[ \mathcal{F}_P : \mathcal{E}_{\text{EVM}} \longrightarrow \text{Ledger} \]
which maps raw tx traces to economic state changes.  Properties like *constant-product* (Uniswap) or *collateral ratio* (Aave) lift to equalities in Ledger.

---

## VI. Time-Indexed Stack (from `thought_004`)

Wrap everything in a presheaf
\[ F\_L : \text{Time}^{op} \to \text{Cat} , \quad t \mapsto \mathcal{E}_{\text{EVM}}^{L}(t) \]
adding one copy per chain L.  Bridges supply natural transformations; forks promote to bicategories.

---

## VII. Cross-Chain Bicategory \(\mathcal{B}\)

* **0-cells** = chains.  
* **1-cells** = bridge functors.  
* **2-cells** = proofs of atomic bundle execution (invertible when all legs succeed).

---

## VIII. Putting It Together – Grothendieck Total Bicategory \(\overline{\mathcal E}\)

Apply the Grothendieck construction to the presheaf of Section VI to obtain a single bicategory whose objects are *(chain, block, address)* triples and whose morphisms are time-shifted EVM traces.  Internal contract categories, token functors, and protocol semantics all lift into \(\overline{\mathcal E}\) via embeddings.

---

## IX. Formalisation Roadmap

1. **Lean4 Skeleton** — import `mathlib4` categories; define partial monoidal category for EVM traces.  
2. **Module per Contract** — auto-generate \(\mathcal{C}_C\) from ABI + Solidity AST.  
3. **Token Functors** — library module proving ERC-20 functorial laws once; reuse per token.  
4. **Protocol Semantics** — formalise Uniswap V2 constant-product; Aave collateral functor; Compound interest accrual (enriched over time).  
5. **Bridge Proof Objects** — model HTLB, zk-light-client as 2-cells; prove invertibility under honest assumptions.  
6. **Automation** — custom Lean tactics to discharge routine composition/identity proofs.  
7. **Verification Pipeline** — compile DSL (thought_006) → Lean term → check → export bundle for execution.

## X. Next Questions

1. Efficient representation of massive hom-sets (millions of addresses).  
2. Gas/revert semantics: partiality vs enriched category with error object.  
3. Probabilistic finality metrics integrated via enrichment.  
4. Scaling proof generation for large bundles (incremental compilation).  
5. UX: visualising diagrams for non-technical auditors.
