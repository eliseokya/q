# Design & Engineering Implementation

This folder contains brainstorming, design documents, and engineering plans for the **actual production implementation** of the Atomic Mesh VM system.

## Purpose

While the `maths/` folder contains the **mathematical framework** and formal verification in Lean 4, this `design/` folder focuses on:

- **Engineering Architecture**: How to build the real system
- **Technology Stack**: What languages, frameworks, and tools to use
- **Implementation Strategy**: How to translate mathematical concepts into production code
- **System Design**: APIs, databases, networking, deployment, etc.
- **User Experience**: How developers and users interact with the system

## Relationship to Mathematical Framework

The Lean 4 mathematical framework serves as the **specification** and **correctness proof** for what we're building. This design work focuses on **how to build it** while ensuring:

✅ **Mathematical Correctness**: Implementation respects categorical laws  
✅ **Performance Requirements**: 51% gas optimization achieved in practice  
✅ **Production Quality**: Scalable, reliable, maintainable system  
✅ **Developer Experience**: Easy to use and integrate

## Key Engineering Questions

1. **Technology Stack**: What programming languages and frameworks?
2. **Architecture**: Microservices vs monolith? Event-driven vs request-response?
3. **Data Storage**: How to store bundles, proofs, and execution state?
4. **Networking**: How do components communicate? P2P vs centralized?
5. **User Interface**: Web app, CLI, SDK, or all three?
6. **Integration**: How do users submit bundles and receive results?
7. **Monitoring**: How to observe system performance and health?
8. **Security**: How to protect against attacks and ensure reliability?

## Design Principles

Based on the mathematical framework, our implementation should be:

- **Categorical**: Respect composition laws and functorial structure
- **Atomic**: Guarantee all-or-nothing execution semantics  
- **Optimized**: Achieve proven gas savings in practice
- **Verifiable**: Enable verification of execution correctness
- **Scalable**: Handle increasing transaction volume
- **Reliable**: High availability and fault tolerance
