# Formalisation & Proof Plan for the Categorical Model of Ethereum

*This document breaks down the implementation of our mathematical model into concrete phases, specifies the proofs required at each stage, and outlines how those proofs will be programmed.  It is designed to be exhaustive enough to interface later with cryptographic-primitive formalisms and the Atomic Mesh VM layer.*

## Guiding Principle ‚Äî The Unix Philosophy

"Write programs that do one thing well. Write programs to work together. Write programs that handle text streams." We embed this ethos across all phases:

1. **Small, single-purpose modules** ‚Äì each Lean file, CLI tool, or compiler pass has a narrowly scoped responsibility and exports a clean interface.
2. **Plain-text, streamable formats** ‚Äì DSL, IR, bundle specs, proof hashes, and logs are UTF-8 text so they can be piped (`|`), redirected (`>`), and processed with common Unix tools (`grep`, `jq`, `awk`).
3. **Composable pipelines** ‚Äì verification and deployment form a chain of independent executables:
   ```sh
   dslc example.dsl | verify-lean | optimise | relay
   ```
4. **Fail-fast transparency** ‚Äì tools exit non-zero on error and emit human-readable diagnostics; no hidden GUIs.
5. **Replaceability** ‚Äì any component (optimiser, bridge engine, even proof assistant) can be swapped without rewriting upstream or downstream modules.
6. **Documentation as code** ‚Äì every tool has a `--help` flag, and Markdown/LaTeX docs live beside source so editors and shell commands can access them.
