/--
Snapshot predicates for restricting `EVM.Trace`s to those valid up to a
particular block height on a given chain.  For now we have no concrete
ledger, so **every successful trace** is deemed valid.  The definition
is a placeholder and will be tightened once we add real state.

/-- Predicate: trace `tr` is admissible on chain `L` by block `t`.  For
now we only require that the trace terminates successfully. -/
